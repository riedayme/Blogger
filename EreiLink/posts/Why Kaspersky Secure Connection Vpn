<p>Public Wi-Fi networks may be under-protected, for example, if a Wi-Fi network uses a vulnerable encryption protocol or a popular Wi-Fi network name (SSID). When you make Internet purchases over insecure Wi-Fi networks, your passwords and other confidential data are transmitted in non-encrypted text. Hackers can intercept your confidential data, find out your bank card number, and obtain access to your money.</p>
<br>

<p>When you connect to a Wi-Fi network, Kaspersky Secure Connection checks the network. If the Wi-Fi network is insecure, Kaspersky Secure Connection prompts you to enable a secure connection via a specially allocated server located in the country you specify. When a secure connection is enabled, data from a website is first received by the allocated server. Kaspersky Secure Connection then sends the data to your device over an encrypted secure connection.</p>
<br>

<p>Kaspersky Secure Connection provides the following advantages:</p>
<br>

<p>Safe use of payment systems and booking sites</p>
<p>Hackers will not be able to intercept your bank card number on a website when you make online payments, book hotel rooms, or rent cars.</p>

<p>Protection for your secret information</p>
<p>No one will be able to determine the IP address of your device or your location.</p>
<br>

<p>Protection of your privacy</p>
<p>No one will be able to intercept and read your private correspondence on social networks, chats, and email websites.</p>
<br>

<p>Kaspersky Secure Connection can also be used for other types of network connections, such as a local Internet connection or USB modem connection.</p>
<br>

<p>By default, Kaspersky Secure Connection does not prompt you to enable a secure connection if the HTTPS protocol is used to connect to a website.</p>
<br>

<p>Changing the country to connect from when visiting websites of banks, payment systems, booking websites, social networks, chats, and email websites could result in the triggering of anti-fraud systems. Anti-fraud systems are intended for analyzing online financial transactions for signs of fraudulent operations.</p>
